      "tangible real-world problems\n",
      "faced by everyone. I loved that we had billboard ads in train stations and we got to speak to our end-users every day. One of my proudest moments: at an Amazon pitch event to people in tech, we were voted the ‘startup most likely to grow exponentially’.\n",
